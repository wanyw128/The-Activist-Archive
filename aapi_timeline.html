               	Robert Aaron Long, 22, shot and killed four people of Asian descent at Youngs Asian Massage in Cherokee County, GA. He then drove to Gold Spa in Atlanta, GA, where he shot and killed three women before killing another Asian woman at Aromatherapy Spa. Long was accused of the murders of these eight people, six of whom were Asian-American women, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole after receiving a guilty verdict for four of the victims on July 27. In August 2021, Long was subjected to charges enhancing his punishment to the death penalty on the classification of his crime as a hate crime based on race and gender. However, on September 28, Long pleaded not guilty.

           <div class="tml-desc ">
             <p >
               Michelle Alyssa Go was shoved to her death in front of an R train in Times Square on a Saturday morning. She was murdered by suspect Simon Martial, a 61-year-old homeless man, who was later charged with second-degree murder. The incident disturbed many people and members of the AAPI community, who have been concerned for their safety in places like NYC since the recent surge of anti-AAPI violence. On January 18, hundreds of people gathered at Time Square to hold a candlelight vigil in honor of Go. 

Another woman claimed to have been approached by Martial minutes prior to the murder, but suspected that she would get pushed onto the tracks, and walked away. Upon investigation of the incident and Martial’s background, police did not find evidence to suggest that Martial’s actions were racially motivated. Some online communities discussed other potential explanations and turned to their leaders and law enforcement to take legislative action and ensure public safety.

           <h3 class="bbl-title">February 13, 2022: Christina Yuna Lee</h3>
           <div class="tml-desc ">
             <p>
               After a Saturday night out, 35-year-old and Korean-American Christina Yuna Lee was going home when she was stalked up six flights of stairs in her Chinatown apartment and stabbed more than 40 times. The suspect, Assamad Nash, had been arrested in early January for jamming MetroCard machines and was granted supervised release during this incident. He was charged with the murder, burglary and burglary as a sexually motivated felony. The incident was not considered a racially-motivated hate crime, but AAPI and allies protested in NYC in light of recent anti-AAPI violence and urged for better policies to support the homeless and mentally ill. On social media, Lee’s case had trended under social justice and anti-AAPI hate tags, and many other female AAPI expressed the racialized misogyny, stereotypes, and sexual remarks they encountered due to their ethnicity and sex. 

     The victim’s memorial later flourished in front of her apartment on Chrystie Street, where people left flowers and lit candles in her memory. Three days later, Lee’s former landlord Brian Chin, found the memorial vandalized.
