Trayvon Benjamin Martin was an unarmed, 17-year-old African-American who was walking home from a convenience store when he was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch captain named George Zimmerman in Stanford, Florida. Zimmerman claimed to have shot Martin in self-defense.

             <p>A month after Martin’s death, rallies across the U.S. demanded Zimmerman's conviction. Public figures and social events, such as President Obama and the MBA, acted in solidarity with Martin. Alicia Garza, one of the founders of the BLM organization, wrote a chain of Facebook posts titled, “A Love Letter to Black People,” encouraging Black activists and commenting on the media’s reactions to Zimmerman’s conviction process. Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi responded to Garza’s messages and began the tag #BlackLivesMatter. On July 13, 2013, the all-female jury found Zimmerman not guilty.

           <div class="tml-desc ">
             <p>Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when Darren Wilson, a white officer, drove by and told them to go on the sidewalk. Minutes later, Wilson fired a total of 12 bullets, and Brown was left with seven gunshot wounds and died on the street, where his body laid for four hours. Following a candlelight vigil, protests erupted where people smashed car windows and looted stores. These riots would continue for nights, and on August 11, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse the protesting crowd. The authorities would later release footage of Brown taking large amounts of cigarillos from the Ferguson Market, upsetting protestors. On May 20, 2015, a permanent plaque was installed nearby Brown’s memorial in the middle of Canfield Drive. Wilson was later indicted and a four-month re-examination of this case concluded that allegations of murder or manslaughter against Wilson were unwarranted.

           <div class="tml-desc ">
             <p >Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was an unarmed athlete jogging near his home in Brunswick, Georgia, when father and son Gregory McMichael, 65, and Travis McMichael, 35, armed themselves with a pistol and a shotgun and pursued Arbery in their pickup truck. William “Roddie” Bryan was a neighbor of the McMichaels who had later followed them to capture a video of the incident and attempt to detain Arbery in the truck. The McMichaels fired three shots, killing Arbery, and claimed self-defense.Georgian citizen arrest laws permit citizens to apprehend suspects of crime.  Gregory McMichael explained that he suspected Arbery to be the burglar involved in a series of local break-ins. These alleged break-ins, however, were neither reported nor filed by the police. 

On February 22, 2022, the three were found guilty of being motivated by racial hate and on all federal hate crime counts of the case, and were sentenced to life in prison. Travis McMichael also faced a weapons charge. Bryan’s recording had spread over the world, raising outrage across nations. After the hate crime verdict, Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, and community, raised their arms in victory, but are planning civil lawsuits against the McMichaels and Bryan. State officials declared February 23rd Arbery Day in Georgia.

           <h3 class="bbl-title">March 13, 2020: Breonna Taylor</h3>
           <div class="tml-desc ">
             <p >Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black emergency room technician, was shot and killed by the police in her own home in Louisville, Kentucky, after officers battered down her front door. The authorities were in search of links to Taylor’s ex-boyfriend, a convict suspected of supplying a local drug house, and received a search warrant to Taylor’s apartment. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker III, were in bed when the police, who were not wearing body cameras, knocked and announced their presence. Walker and Taylor shouted to ask who was at the door, but got no response, so Walker thought they were intruders and fired a shot with a gun he legally owned. Brett Hankison and other officers sent shots through the door, many of which had hit and killed Breonna Taylor when she walked into the hallway. In June 2020, Hankison was fired from the police department. Walker was charged with attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault, but prosecutors later dropped the charges. The authorities did not find drugs in Taylor’s apartment and concluded that she was not involved with her ex-boyfriend’s case. 

Near the end of May 2020, Walker’s 911 call where he told a dispatcher, “Somebody kicked in the door, shot my girlfriend,” was released and fueled protests against police brutality, which had initially sparked due to the murder of George Floyd, who had died days earlier in Minneapolis. Hankison was the only officer indicted on September 23 on three counts of wanton endangerment, as he was accused of blindly firing at a neighboring apartment where a pregnant woman, a man, and a child were home. The former officer was acquitted, and in March of 2022, he pleaded not guilty on all three counts. 

The verdict devastated activists across nations, as virtual social media campaigns spread using the tag #SayHerName to bring justice and awareness to Taylor’s case. State legislature passed reforms in Louisville police departments and signed “Breonna’s Law” in June 2020, limiting no-knock search warrants and requiring officers to wear body cameras when carrying out search warrants. In September 2020, the city of Louisville agreed to pay Taylor’s family a $12 million wrongful-death lawsuit settlement. 

“Justice for Breonna means that we will continue to save lives in her honor,” Tamika Palmer, Taylor’s mother, said. “No amount of money accomplishes that, but the police reform measures that we were able to get passed as a part of this settlement mean so much more to my family, our community, and to Breonna’s legacy.”

           <h3 class="bbl-title">May 25, 2020: George Floyd</h3>
           <div class="tml-desc ">
             <p>On May 25, 2020,  Minneapolis police received a 911 call from Cups Food convenience store reporting a person who tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. Three Minneapolis police officers encountered and held George Floyd, a 41-year-old African-American man, to the ground and handcuffed him. Former officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for around nine minutes while Floyd cried out “I can’t breathe,” despite bystanders yelling at him to stop. Later at the hospital, Floyd was pronounced dead. Chauvin and three other officers; Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao, were fired. 

Minutes after the confrontation, a witness video was posted online. The media soon began to call for the arrest of Chauvin and bystanding officers. Throughout the following weeks, protests escalated and spread across cities in the U.S., as crowds started fires and shoved signs in the air, quoting Floyd’s cries for help. Activists and people of various communities also demanded for legislators to defund and reform police departments. 

On April 20, 2021, Chauvin is convicted of murder and manslaughter charges, and is prescribed 22.5 years in prison on June 25. In May, the federal grand jury indicted Chauvin, Lane, Kueng, and Thao on civil rights charges. Later in December, Chauvin pleads guilty to violating Floyd’s civil rights. The other three officers would also be found guilty for depriving Floyd of his right to medical care. Sentencing has not yet taken place for the federal civil rights charges. In June 2022, Lane, Keung, and Thao will go on trial for charges of two counts each of aiding and abetting Floyd’s murder.
